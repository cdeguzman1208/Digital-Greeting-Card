# Digital Greeting Card
For our first Processing sketch, we'll be creating digital greeting cards, or 'E-cards'
The goal of this assignment is to teach the basics of Processing while also instilling the concept of "code as a paintbrush", or making art using code alone. 

## Requirements
- Start with a simple object. Try to recreate it with only code. “code as paintbrush”
 - You may not use the Image part of Processing in the final, but you are permitted to use it as a "tracing tool"
- Add some Text. You should make this for someone, so try to personalize it (b-day gift?)
- Animate it! Look for ways to animate select parts of your E-Card.  It does not need to be the full sketch, smaller animations are encouraged. 
 - This can be color, shape, position, rotation, scale, or any mix of these. 
 - The animation does not need to loop.
